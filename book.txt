007:002 for your own judgement will be dealt—and your own
        measure meted—to yourselves.
007:003 And why do you look at the splinter in your brother's eye,
        and not notice the beam which is in your own eye?
007:004 Or how say to your brother, `Allow me to take the splinter
        out of your eye,' while the beam is in your own eye?
007:005 Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye,
        and then you will see clearly how to remove the splinter
        from your brother's eye.
007:006 "Give not that which is holy to the dogs, nor throw your pearls
        to the swine; otherwise they will trample them under their
        feet and then turn and attack you.
007:007 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;
        knock, and the door will be opened to you.
007:008 For it is always he who asks that receives, he who seeks that finds,
        and he who knocks that has the door opened to him.
007:009 What man is there among you, who if his son shall ask him
        for bread will offer him a stone?
007:010 Or if the son shall ask him for a fish will offer him a snake?

007:011 If you then, imperfect as you are, know how to give good gifts
        to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven
        give good things to those who ask Him!
007:012 Everything, therefore, be it what it may, that you would
        have men do to you, do you also the same to them; for in this
        the Law and the Prophets are summed up.
007:013 "Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad the road
        which leads to ruin, and many there are who enter by it;
007:014 because narrow is the gate and contracted the road which leads
        to Life, and few are those who find it.
007:015 "Beware of the false teachers—men who come to you in sheep's fleeces,
        but beneath that disguise they are ravenous wolves.
007:016 By their fruits you will easily recognize them.
        Are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from brambles?
007:017 Just so every good tree produces good fruit, but a poisonous
        tree produces bad fruit.
007:018 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor a poisonous tree good fruit.

007:019 Every tree which does not yield good fruit is cut down and thrown aside for burning.

007:020 So by their fruits at any rate, you will easily recognize them.

007:021 "Not every one who says to me, `Master, Master,' will enter
        the Kingdom of the Heavens, but only those who are obedient
        to my Father who is in Heaven.
007:022 Many will say to me on that day, "`Master, Master, have we
        not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name expelled demons,
        and in Thy name performed many mighty works?'
007:023 "And then I will tell them plainly, "`I never knew you:
        begone from me, you doers of wickedness.'
007:024 "Every one who hears these my teachings and acts upon them will
        be found to resemble a wise man who builds his house upon rock;
007:025 and the heavy rain falls, the swollen torrents come, and the winds
        blow and beat against the house; yet it does not fall,
        for its foundation is on rock.
007:026 And every one who hears these my teachings and does not act
        upon them will be found to resemble a fool who builds his
        house upon sand.
007:027 The heavy rain descends, the swollen torrents come,
        and the winds blow and burst upon the house, and it falls;
        and disastrous is the fall."
007:028 When Jesus had concluded this discourse, the crowds were filled
        with amazement at His teaching,
007:029 for He had been teaching them as one who had authority,
        and not as their Scribes taught.
008:001 Upon descending from the hill country He was followed
        by immense crowds.
008:002 And a leper came to Him, and throwing himself at His feet,
        said, "Sir, if only you are willing you are able to cleanse me."
008:003 So Jesus put out His hand and touched him, and said, "I am willing:
        be cleansed." Instantly he was cleansed from his leprosy;
008:004 and Jesus said to him, "Be careful to tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses appointed as evidence for them."

008:005 After His entry into Capernaum a Captain came to Him,
        and entreated Him.
008:006 "Sir," he said, "my servant at home is lying ill with paralysis,
        and is suffering great pain."
008:007 "I will come and cure him," said Jesus.
